# Lambda Implementation for Gaming Playtime APIs

## Steam Playtime Endpoint Implementation

The Steam playtime API endpoint has been implemented as a Lambda function with the following details:

- **Function Name**: gaming-playtime-tracker-steamPlaytime
- **API Endpoint**: GET /steam/playtime/{steamId}
- **API Gateway URL**: https://z64k92s2uj.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev

### Implementation Details
- AWS Lambda function with Node.js 18.x runtime
- DynamoDB table for rate limiting
- Returns mock data for testing
- Includes proper error handling and CORS headers

### Sample Response
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "steamId": "76561198012345678",
  "totalPlaytime": 1234,
  "games": [
    { "name": "Counter-Strike 2", "playtime": 450 },
    { "name": "Dota 2", "playtime": 320 },
    { "name": "PUBG", "playtime": 280 },
    { "name": "Elden Ring", "playtime": 184 }
  ]
}
```

## Xbox Playtime Endpoint Implementation

The Xbox playtime API endpoint has been implemented as a Lambda function with the following details:

- **Function Name**: gaming-playtime-tracker-xboxPlaytime
- **API Endpoint**: GET /xbox/playtime/{xboxId}
- **API Gateway URL**: https://z64k92s2uj.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev

### Implementation Details
- AWS Lambda function with Node.js 18.x runtime
- Same DynamoDB table for rate limiting as the Steam implementation
- Returns mock data for testing
- Includes proper error handling and CORS headers
- Fixed rate limiter to properly use expression attribute names for 'ttl'

### Sample Response
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "xboxId": "xboxuser123",
  "totalPlaytime": 987,
  "games": [
    { "name": "Halo Infinite", "playtime": 230 },
    { "name": "Forza Horizon 5", "playtime": 185 },
    { "name": "Sea of Thieves", "playtime": 150 },
    { "name": "Minecraft", "playtime": 422 }
  ]
}
```

## PlayStation Playtime Endpoint Implementation

The PlayStation playtime API endpoint has been implemented as a Lambda function with the following details:

- **Function Name**: gaming-playtime-tracker-playstationPlaytime
- **API Endpoint**: GET /playstation/playtime/{psnId}
- **API Gateway URL**: https://z64k92s2uj.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev

### Implementation Details
- AWS Lambda function with Node.js 18.x runtime
- Same DynamoDB table for rate limiting as the other implementations
- Uses PlayStation Trophy API to estimate playtime
- Includes proper error handling and CORS headers
- OAuth 2.0 authentication with the PlayStation API

### Sample Response
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "psnId": "playstation_user",
  "totalPlaytime": 587,
  "games": [
    { "name": "God of War Ragnar√∂k", "playtime": 145 },
    { "name": "Horizon Forbidden West", "playtime": 120 },
    { "name": "Marvel's Spider-Man", "playtime": 85 },
    { "name": "Ghost of Tsushima", "playtime": 90 },
    { "name": "The Last of Us Part II", "playtime": 105 },
    { "name": "Uncharted 4", "playtime": 42 }
  ]
}
```

### Next Steps
1. Add actual Steam API integration - Done
2. Fix DynamoDB rate limiter to use expression attribute names for 'ttl' - Done
3. Implement other gaming platform endpoints - Done (Xbox and PlayStation implemented)
4. Add actual Xbox API integration - Done
5. Add PlayStation API integration - Done
6. Consider additional platforms (Nintendo, Epic Games, etc.)
7. Add API documentation with Swagger/OpenAPI
8. Improve error handling and logging
9. Implement caching mechanism to reduce API calls
